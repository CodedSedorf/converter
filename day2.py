#Inputs
#We will provide an input that asks for username and then we'll print a customized message to the user
#Input is an in built function in python programming just like your tv remote which comes with different button that performs different function. Eg volume, power , forward etc. Therefore in python we also have some in built functions like print, input etc. The parenthesis is used to trigger or call a function.

#use input to get users name and then store the value in a variable name
#Explain reason for the space after the question mark
name = input("What is your name? ")
#Here we are concatenating string and string together
#This is another epression
print("Hi " + name)

ur_name = input("What is your name? ")
